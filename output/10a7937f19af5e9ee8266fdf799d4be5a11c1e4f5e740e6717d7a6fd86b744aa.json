This implies a significant risk at the retail level because the demand for these calls can increase and erode the result of the PlusNet Mobile product as a whole. However, because TDC is active on both the retail market and the wholesale markets and enjoys revenue from the wholesale products, TDC as a group does not run the same risk as companies only active on the retail market.
