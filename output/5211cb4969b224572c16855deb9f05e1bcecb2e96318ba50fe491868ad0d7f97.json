Marketing areas were defined by postal codes. Under competition law companies are required to act independently of each other and subject to the pressure exerted by competitors. The division of markets into geographical marketing areas reduces the competitive pressure to which the Botex stores are exposed and affects the members' strategic choices, for example in relation to pricing. In addition, a restriction on the possibility to market oneself can hinder consumers' access to information and, thus, their ability to compare the individual Botex stores on parameters such as price and quality. Overall, this can lead to higher prices, poorer service, inferior quality and a more limited supply.</p>",
