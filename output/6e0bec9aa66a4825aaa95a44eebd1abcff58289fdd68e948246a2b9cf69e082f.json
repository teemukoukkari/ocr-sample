A mink farmer who does not want to participate in the eradication inflicts an increased danger of infection on other farmers. In addition, such behaviour in-flicts a risk on the forage producers that they will carry the infection to other mink farmers whereby such a producer will seem less attractive. In this consideration The Danish Competition Authority lays stress on the fact that the farmers have the possibility to participate in an insurance arrangement whereby the loss from the eradication is compensated.</p>",
