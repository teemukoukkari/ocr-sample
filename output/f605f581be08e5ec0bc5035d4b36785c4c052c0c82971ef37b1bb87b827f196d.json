Certain provisions of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive may require revision, particularly in light of the implementation of a Global Minimum Tax through the Pillar 2 Directive, as well as of significant changes in the broader economic landscape, now characterised by rising interest rates and high inflation. For example, the Controlled Foreign Company rules partially overlap with Pillar 2 rules, which could lead to instances of economic double taxation and create unnecessary administrative burdens. Furthermore, the Interest Limitation Rule does not appear to adequately address earnings volatility that may arise from an entity's life cycle or from broader economic conditions, nor does it adequately reflect sector-specific characteristics. Consequently, an entity's ability to deduct interest expenses may be restricted beyond the intended purpose of the Directive. Lastly, the scope of the General Anti-Abuse Rule may require review to ensure that it is broad enough to cover all relevant direct taxes. These provisions of the current Directive should be reconsidered and adjusted to remain both relevant to the market and economic circumstances over time. They should be addressed in a harmonised manner across the EU, while retaining the overall purpose and key objectives of the Directive, which remain relevant.</p>",

These consultations involved all Member States (in a bilateral and multilateral context) and around 50 multinational groups of companies and business associations. The comprehensive output that emerged from this process of analysis and extensive stakeholder consultations will feed into the Omnibus proposal and inform the policy choices therein. In addition, relevant stakeholders can provide their views, evidence and experience regarding the abovementioned Directives through this Call for Evidence.
