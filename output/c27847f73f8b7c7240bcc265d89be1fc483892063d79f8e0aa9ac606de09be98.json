For the present request for a preliminary ruling, the Court must address the relatively little-known Council Directive 2008/7/EC concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital. (<a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote2\">2)</a> That directive prohibits Member States from levying indirect taxes on contributions of capital.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">2. The question of interpretation to be answered appears somewhat odd, <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote3\">(3)</a> as the referring court questions the permissibility of a tax on transfers of immovable property that is usually levied not only on the direct acquisition of immovable property but also on the indirect acquisition of immovable property by way of acquisition of a company or partnership owning that property. Both for reasons of equal treatment and to prevent circumvention arrangements, such taxation is in fact mandatory under tax law. In the absence of such provisions, it is likely that all immovable property would be transferred by way of contributions to capital companies, and the shares in those companies subsequently sold, to achieve an identical result in economic terms – transfer of the right of disposal over immovable property – without incurring any tax liability.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">3. Nevertheless, the tax on transfers of immovable property that is payable in respect of a contribution of capital under company law (in the form, in the present case, of the contribution in kind of shareholdings in another company, which owns immovable property) is an annoyance in particular in the context of restructuring operations. That explains the attempt to challenge it by reference to EU law (Directive 2008/7, in the present case).</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">4. The Court has the opportunity here to clarify the scope of Directive 2008/7. It is undisputed that the directive does not prohibit Member States from introducing a national tax on transfers of immovable property. However, the question arises whether the abovementioned extension of the tax on transfers of immovable property to cover the transfer of shares in companies that own immovable property may infringe that directive. If so, that could make it impossible in general to levy tax on transfers of immovable property. That is because, as a rule, national law would not permit transactions which are economically identical in their effect to be treated differently – assuming that national law, as it so often does, recognises a principle of equal treatment comparable to Article 20 of the Charter. It therefore once again <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote4\">(4</a>) falls to the Court to rule on the continued validity of the national (non-harmonised) tax law of the Member States – in the present case, the tax on transfers of immovable property.</li></ul></p>",

It is clear from recital 7 thereof that Directive 2008/7 concerns capital raised by a company or firm.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">29.

That tax is levied in respect of the transfer of the right of disposal over immovable property, usually by way of a transfer of ownership to another person, (<a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote5\">5</a>) and is calculated, in principle, on the basis of the price paid for the transfer. Whether such a tax on transfers of immovable property is dogmatically regarded as a transfer tax (as understood historically), or, compared with value added tax (VAT) (which is a general tax on consumption), as a special tax on consumption (taxation of the acquisition of a specific consumer good in the form of immovable property), may remain an open question. In any event, a tax on transfers of immovable property per se has nothing to do with taxation of capital raised or of the contribution of capital. It follows that a tax on transfers of immovable property is not a prohibited tax on contributions of capital for the purposes of Article 5 of Directive 2008/7.</li></ul></p>",

      "html": "<p block-type=\"ListGroup\"><ul><li block-type=\"ListItem\">30. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the conclusion arrived at above might be different where  as in the present case – a tax on transfers of immovable property is levied in the context of the formation of a capital company and the contribution of shares.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">31. Even considering only the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States and the limited powers of the European Union in tax matters, a broad interpretation to the effect that any tax connected with contributions of capital to a company is covered by the prohibition laid down in Article 5 of Directive 2008/7 cannot be permissible. Although the Court has ruled differently with regard to the Parent-Subsidiary Directive, <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote6\">(6</a>) that very broad statement is limited to that directive and cannot be applied to Directive 2008/7. That is because – as the Court has correctly pointed out in that respect – the harmonisation provided for in Directive 2008/7 does not extend to direct taxes, which are a matter for the Member States themselves, <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote7\">(7</a>) such as tax on transfers of immovable property.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">32. Therefore, the determination which must be made is whether IMT is to be considered another tax with the same characteristics as capital duty and stamp duty on securities – as expressly referred to in recital 2 – and so is in fact levied on the raising of capital, or whether it is levied only in connection with the formation of a capital company but has a different object of taxation. That is relevant because Directive 2008/7 prohibits only such taxes which have the same characteristics – and therefore the same object of taxation – as capital duty. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote8\">(8</a>)</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">33. Accordingly, the actual object of IMT in the specific case needs to be identified, and it must be ascertained whether IMT is also payable where shares in a company that owns immovable property are merely transferred without that resulting in the formation of a company or a contribution to the capital of the company being formed. If that is the case, then the focus is not on the raising of capital; rather, there is a different object of taxation.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">34. It is to that effect that the Court's decision regarding the previous directive concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital (Directive 69/335/EEC (<a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote9\">9)</a>) in connection with a tax on trade in securities should be understood. In that case, Spain had taxed the transfer of securities (regardless of scale) of companies where at least 50% of their assets comprised immovable property situated in national territory. The Court correctly rejected Spain's objection that the case in actual fact concerned the transfer of immovable property rather than the transfer of securities,(<a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote10\">10</a>) and instead foregrounded the event actually giving rise to the tax (the transfer of securities).</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">35. That case concerned only the transfer of shares in a company owning immovable property, rather than the economic transfer of immovable property. The scale of the shareholdings acquired was therefore irrelevant. Moreover, the tax was calculated on the basis of the value of the shares, not the value of the immovable property. In the case at hand, therefore, the focus was on all transfers of shareholdings in particular companies (having certain assets). Consequently, the Court examined the tax on trade in securities with reference to the predecessor to Directive 2008/7 – and found that it was compatible with the directive. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote11\">(11</a>)</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">36. Another decision of the Court along the same lines is its ruling that (the predecessor to) the directive does not cover taxation of the appreciation in value of immovable property in the context of a contribution of assets to a company's capital, as that does not constitute capital duty. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote12\">(12)</a> Similarly, the Court in a later decision focused on the object of taxation and held that a tax which is more in the nature of a direct tax on income does not come within the scope of the directive concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital and does not therefore constitute a prohibited tax. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote13\">(13</a>) The decision on a registration fee payable by traders follows the same line. Since the registration fee, although it concerned all capital companies which by operation of law were to be treated as traders, also applied to other legal forms (sole traders), the Court ruled that Directive 2008/7 did not preclude it. (<a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote14\">14</a>)</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">37. The greatest similarity to the situation in the present case is apparent in the decision of the Court on the permissibility of a vehicle registration charge levied in France. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote15\">(15)</a> That charge did not come within the scope of the directive, even though it was levied on account of a merger of two capital companies, because that was only the triggering</li></ul></p>",

      "html": "<p block-type=\"ListGroup\"><ul><li block-type=\"ListItem\">38. On closer examination of the Portuguese legislation, it may be stated  subject to the assessment of the referring court – that the focus in the present case is not the transfer of securities or of shareholdings. The object of IMT is – as both the Federal Republic of Germany and the Portuguese Republic maintain – the transfer of the right of ownership over immovable property. Indirect acquisition by way of the transfer of at least 75% of the shares or interests in a company or partnership which owns immovable property is equated to such direct acquisition of ownership.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">39. It can be assumed that the reason for drawing that equivalence is that the transfer of more than 75% of shareholdings transfers to another person the beneficial right of disposal not only over the company but also over its immovable property. The tax is thus levied on the change from one person to another of the beneficial right of disposal over immovable property, and not on any form of raising of capital. Since it is possible to transfer the beneficial power of disposal over immovable property from one person to another by way of direct acquisition (what is known as an asset deal) or by way of indirect acquisition (what is known as a share deal), it is logical that Portugal treats the two means of transferring the power of disposal in the same way under tax law.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">40. Another aspect demonstrating that IMT is not intended as a means of taxing the capital raised by the contribution or the contributed shareholdings is that the basis of assessment is not the value of the contributed company or the value of the contributed shareholdings but solely the value of the immovable property, <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footnote17\">(17)</a> over which a new person (the acquiring company – in the present case, NOVA) now has the beneficial power of disposal. That also suggests an object of taxation that is not comparable to that of capital duty or stamp duty on securities. That is confirmed by the fact that not only a contribution to a capital company but also the acquisition of 75% of a company's shareholdings by, for example, a natural person will trigger the tax on transfers of immovable property.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">41. I am even inclined to say that liability for tax on transfers of immovable property in connection with a share deal is mandatory having regard to equality in the taxation of taxable persons and taxation according to ability to pay. Otherwise, liability for tax on transfers of immovable property would be relatively easy to circumvent by contributing immovable property to a capital company before its planned sale and, at some time in the future, simply transferring all shares in that company.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">42. In that respect, a rule that covers and ensures taxation of the transfer of the controlling majority in companies which own immovable property is a necessary complement to a tax on transfers of immovable property. However, if a tax on transfers of immovable property does not in itself constitute an indirect tax on contributions of capital, then a necessary complement to that tax cannot be treated any differently. Therefore, a necessary complement of that kind, which is linked to the indirect transfer of immovable property by way of the transfer of controlling shareholdings and thereby ensures equality of taxation and puts into practice the tax-law principle of taxation according to ability to pay, also cannot constitute a tax on contributions of capital.</li></ul></p>",

I therefore propose that the questions referred by the Tribunal Arbitral Tributário (Centro de Arbitragem Administrativa – CAAD) (Tax Arbitration Tribunal (Centre for Administrative Arbitration), Portugal) be answered as follows:</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">1. A tax which is levied on transfers, for consideration, of the right of ownership, or parts of that right, over immovable property, is not to be regarded as an 'indirect tax on the raising of capital' within the meaning of Directive 2008/7/EC of 12 February 2008 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital. The same applies where any situation by virtue of which a shareholder comes to hold at least 75% of the shares in a company owning immovable property is treated in the same way as a transfer of immovable property.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">2. Article 6(1)(b) of Directive 2008/7 makes it clear that 'transfer duties'  such as a tax on transfers of immovable property – are not covered by that directive. The taxation of an indirect change of ownership (transfer of the right of disposal over immovable property on the basis of a majority shareholding or interest in the company which owns the property) also amounts to a transfer duty. Article 8 of Directive 2008/7 therefore does not give rise to any limitation on the rate set for tax on transfers of immovable property.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\"><a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footref1\">1</a> Original language: German.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\"><a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footref2\">2</a> Council Directive of 12 February 2008 (OJ 2008 L 46, p. 11).</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\"><a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footref3\">3</a> For the Bundesfinanzhof (Federal Fiscal Court) in Germany, the answer is so clear that it did not make a reference for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice – see judgment of the Bundesfinanzhof (Federal Fiscal Court) of 19 December 2007 – II R 65/06, BStBl. II 2008, 489, paragraph 24, with reference to the judgment of the Court of Justice of 11 December 1997, <i>Locamion</i> (C‑8/96, EU:C:1997:601).</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\"><a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footref4\">4</a> To take a recent decision as a basis (judgment of 19 December 2024, <i>Credit</i> <i>Suisse</i> <i>Securities</i> <i>(Europe)</i> (C‑601/23, EU:C:2024:1048)), the Court has destroyed the global distinction between unlimited and limited tax liability in non-harmonised income tax law for the EU Member States. It is not entirely clear, however, whether that was a deliberate decision or rather an 'accident' which should be remedied as soon as possible on the basis of another request for a preliminary ruling, similar to the judgment of 8 September 2015, <i>Taricco</i> <i>and</i> <i>Others</i> (C‑105/14, EU:C:2015:555, paragraph 58) and the subsequent correction effected by the judgment of 5 December 2017, <i>M.A.S.</i> <i>and</i> <i>M.B.</i> (C‑42/17, EU:C:2017:936, paragraph 62).</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\"><a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footref5\">5</a> In Germany, for example, that is also conceivable without a transfer of ownership, as legal transactions which, without establishing a right to transfer ownership, legally or commercially enable another person to make use, for that person's own account, of property located in Germany, are also subject to tax on the transfer of immovable property (see Paragraph 1(2) of the German Grunderwerbsteuergesetz (Law on tax on transfers of immovable property)).</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\"><a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-9a24d05b-4b6d-40a5-91c5-3feb25f3ecda.html#Footref6\">6</a> Judgment of 1 August 2025, <i>Banca</i> <i>Mediolanum</i> (C‑92/24 to C‑94/24, EU:C:2025:599, paragraph 41  any tax, whatever its nature).
