The mere fact that they have coordinated an increase or a possibility for an increase in the subscription prices is sufficient to view the agreement and/or concerted practice as a device to reduce the competition, as this has changed the service providers' incentives to compete with each other. The service providers' incentive to determine their pricing policy independently has been limited, and the agreement was therefore capable of reducing the price competition between the parties. With market terms put out of force the coordination was likely o result in higher prices to the detriment of end users.</p>",
