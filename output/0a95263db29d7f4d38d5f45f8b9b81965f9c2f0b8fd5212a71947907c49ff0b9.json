The 3, respectively 2, remaining large wholesalers on the two markets could after the concentration relative easily monitor each others prices and other market behavior.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">The companies would after the merger know that it would not pay to try to win market shares by reducing prices. The close customer contact and the high level of transparency mean that the competitor quickly will detect price changes and follow suit. An aggressive pricing strategy would therefore be expected to result in retaliation by the remaining 1-2 large companies end therefore lower earnings rather than a volume growth. Therefore the merger would lead to a situation where it pays for the companies to raise prices and compete less vigorously for the customers.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">The large majority of the customers on the relevant markets are minor companies that make frequent use of day-to-day delivery of minor orders. They have little buyer power that can be used to counterbalance the large wholesalers, e.g. by demanding lower prices or try to get deliveries from supplies outside Denmark.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">The entry barriers are already, before the merger, high. This makes it difficult for new competitors to enter the market. It is, inter alia, caused by high customer demand of service level, geographical coverage, and to the breadth and depth of the product range. The barriers is exemplified by the fact that new wholesalers have not been able to take significant market shares during the last 5-10 years unless it happened as part of a merger with already existing wholesalers. The concentration would further raise entry barriers because an interesting subject for a take over from a new entrant would disappear.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">All in all, it is the conclusion that the likelihood that the few remaining companies with significant market strength would raise prices and compete less vigorously for the customers on both markets increases compared to the situation where the concentration is blocked.</li></ul></p>",
