Accordingly, there are three conditions that must be met before the authority can issue an order for the termination or repayment of aid. First, the aid must be from public funds, to the benefit of a specific business activity. Second, it must be shown that the aid directly or indirectly causes or has as its object the distortion of competition. And third, the aid must not be legitimate under public regulations: competition law cannot take precedence over a political decision that is made under a regulation.</p>",

First of all, Funen County has granted aid to Portal Fyn both direct through subsidies and indirect by marketing the portal and by giving Portal Fyn the right to use the domain, fyn.dk, free of charge. Secondly, it was established that Portal Fyn had been overcompensated by 46.542 dkr. The Competition Authority applied the net additional cost test to show that the compensation exceeded Portal Fyn's net cost including a reasonable profit. Thirdly, the authority controlling the county deemed the aid illegal, because Funen County had not ensured that a clear delineation between commercial and non-commercial activities was made. Accordingly, the county had not made sufficient effort to ensure that aid was not used to establish and develop commercial parts of the portal. On that basis, the Competition Council issued an order for a repayment of the illegal and competition distorting aid granted by Funen County.</p>",
