Yet, on the other hand, the test identified a number of hours in which E2 obtained extreme profit-rates which could potentially indicate that E2 – in some hours manipulated the prices upward. In light of this a supplementary analysis of the bid curves of E2 was carried out in order to identify the strategic behaviour of E2 in hours with extreme profit-rates.</p>",
