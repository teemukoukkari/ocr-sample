The Commission proposed <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote19\">(19)</a> those measures as a result of serious, systemic, widespread and intertwined irregularities, deficiencies and weaknesses in public procurement procedures in Hungary and limitations concerning prosecution of the corruption in that Member State. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote20\">(20)</a> By that decision, the Council suspended 55% of budgetary commitments (<a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote21\">21</a>) for three cohesion policy programmes <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote22\">(22)</a> for the period from 2021 to 2027. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote23\">(23)</a></li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">15.

The Parliament and the Commission disagreed on the appropriate standard of review that the Court should apply when assessing the Commission's decision on the fulfilment of the enabling condition relating to the independence of the judiciary under the CPR.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">53. The Parliament considers that such an assessment requires a full review by the Court. On the contrary, the Commission is of the view that the review carried out by the Court should only determine whether the Commission committed a <i>manifest</i> <i>error</i> of assessment. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote50\">(50)</a></li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">54. In principle, the intensity of review performed by the Court will depend on the degree of deference the Court should give to an EU institution in respect of the decision under review. That, in turn, will depend on whether or not, and to what extent, the applicable law leaves discretion to the institution in adopting that decision. In principle, the broader the discretion left to the institution, the less intrusive the Court's review should be, as it need examine only the limits of that discretion.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">55. In that respect, it seems that two different steps can be distinguished in relation to the rule of law criterion as part of budgetary conditionality.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">56. In the first step, the EU institutions (the Commission alone under the CPR, and the Council on the proposal from the Commission under the RRF and the Conditionality Regulations) lay down the specific requirements which a particular Member State must satisfy – in order to secure payment from the budget – so as to protect the financial interests of the European Union.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">57. At that stage, as the parties to these proceedings have agreed, the Commission enjoys discretion to assess the situation in a Member State and decide which conditions are necessary and sufficient to safeguard the European Union's budgetary interests. That discretion is, in the first place, limited by the purpose of the rule of law conditionality in the budgetary context, which is to ensure the proper use of EU funds. (<a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote51\">51)</a> In the second place, in the context of the CPR, that discretion is guided by Article 9(1) of the CPR, which requires both Member States and the Commission to ensure respect for fundamental rights and compliance with the Charter in the implementation of the funds, as well as by Article 15 of and Annex III to the CPR, which list the horizontal enabling conditions, including the Charter HEC. Those provisions require the Commission to ensure respect for the Charter, but are silent as to the precise means of doing so.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">58. Therefore, the Commission enjoys certain discretion to determine what is necessary to ensure respect for the Charter HEC in an individual Member State and it can impose, within the boundaries of its discretion, the specific requirements which that State must fulfil before payment from the budget is allowed.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">59. In relation to the 10 programmes proposed by Hungary, the Commission exercised such discretion when adopting the approval decisions. As the Commission stressed at the hearing, those decisions were not challenged. Therefore, how the Commission exercised its discretion when adopting those decisions and laying down concrete requirements for Hungary under the Charter HEC is not at issue in the present case.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">60. The present case calls for a judicial review of the Commission's decision taken in the second step.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">61. In the second step, after the Member State that was required to take measures to conform to the Charter HEC informs the Commission that such measures have been taken, the Commission must, in accordance with Article 15(4) of the CPR, assess whether the conditions agreed upon have been fulfilled.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">62. In that step, the Commission does not, in principle, enjoy any discretion. Article 15(2) of the CPR provides that an enabling condition is fulfilled where <i>all</i> <i>the</i> <i>related</i> <i>criteria</i> <i>are</i> <i>met</i>, which, to my mind, includes the specific Charter HEC</li></ul></p>",

In other words, once the Commission has set the specific requirements in the approval decisions, it can decide to enable payment only if all those requirements are met.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">64. That means that the judicial review by the Court must focus on the correctness of the Commission's assessment concerning a Member State's fulfilment of each requirement. That is a factual assessment requiring, in the present case, an analysis of Hungarian reforms. Part of the Parliament's claims (for example its claim in relation to the new legislation on the points system for the election of judges or its claim in relation to the new rules on the election of the President of Kúria (Supreme Court)) require such a review on the appropriateness of Hungarian reforms. Given that the Commission has no discretion in that respect, the mere finding of an error of assessment should result in the annulment of a decision. In other words, to ensure the European Union's financial interests, the Court must be satisfied that there are <i>no</i> <i>errors</i> <i>of</i> <i>assessment</i>, and not merely that there are no <i>manifest</i> errors of assessment of the amendments implemented by Hungary.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">65. With that said, many of the Parliament's complaints in the present case are not of that nature. That institution is not challenging, or at least not in the majority of its arguments, the factual findings of the Commission, even though it describes its pleas in terms of 'flawed assessment'. (<a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote52\">52)</a> There is no dispute regarding, for instance, whether or not certain pieces of Hungarian legislation were in force at the time when the contested decision was adopted. Rather, the dispute giving rise to the Parliament's claims, in essence, concerns the question of whether the Commission had some leeway to release the funds even though the imposed requirements were not fulfilled to the last detail.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">66. To my mind, the answer to that question can be found only when considered in the light of the purpose of the imposition of the Charter HEC, which is to ensure that the financial interests of the European Union are safeguarded. In that respect, when it adopts a decision lifting the suspension of payments, the Commission should have some leeway when deciding whether or not there still exists a risk to the European Union's financial interests, even if some of the concrete requirements are not (yet) – or at least not fully – fulfilled. Equally, the Commission must also take into consideration any other relevant developments – whether they be legislative or practical developments in the Member State under review – and have the power to refuse to release the funds on the basis that those developments diminish or undermine the concrete reforms undertaken under the Charter HEC. Such discretion must be available to the Commission in order to account for particular situations which cannot be predicted in advance.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">67. However, the Court must be able to perform its judicial review by taking account of the Commission's 'adjustments for reality'. For that purpose, if the Commission, in its decision lifting the suspension of payment, departs from one of the concrete conditions set under the Charter HEC, it must provide reasons as to why it nevertheless considered each requirement to have been fulfilled in substance so that the financial interests of the European Union are not at risk.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">68. Such an explanation by the Commission is due at the moment of the adoption of a decision, because, without it, it would be difficult to assess whether a judicial review is necessary in the first place. Even if such a decision is formally addressed solely to the Member State concerned, there are larger public interests behind that decision, namely the disbursement of public money. For that reason, and especially in situations where the release of the funds had previously been suspended, the Commission owes an explanation not only to Hungary, but to the EU citizenry at large. That is also an argument in favour of requiring the publication of such a decision. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote53\">(53</a>)</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">69. With that in mind, in the present case, the Court must assess whether the Commission, in fact, decided to release the funds despite the concrete requirements under the Charter HEC for Hungary not having been fulfilled, and whether its justification for departing from some of those requirements is sufficient to allow the Court to conclude that there no longer exists any risk to the financial interests of the European Union.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">70. The main arguments raised by the Parliament in its first plea are (i) that the Commission did not thoroughly conduct the assessment of the legislative reforms in Hungary which it itself required in the approval decisions; (ii) that not all of the reforms were in place at the time when the Commission adopted the contested decision; and (iii) that the Commission did not take into consideration other relevant developments not addressed in the approval decisions. The Parliament's main argument in its second plea is that the reasoning required in the contested decision was missing.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">71. I propose that the Court should be guided by the following in assessing such arguments.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">72. First, it seems clear to me that the Commission is bound by the requirements that it has itself set for Hungary in the approval decisions. As stated by the Commission, each of the specific requirements, designed to respond to one or more of the identified deficiencies, must have a direct link to the management and implementation of the funds. Therefore, one must presume that without the fulfilment of those requirements, the European Union's financial interests would remain at risk. In that respect, Hungary must implement all the reforms indicated in those decisions and the Commission cannot, in principle, release payments before such a time.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">73. Second, as noted above, it may be too rigid to require that the reforms be implemented to the last detail, as the Commission must be in a position to adjust its assessment to each individual situation. However, if the Commission</li></ul></p>",

The Commission claims that, under the act on judicial reforms (Act X of 2023), 'almost all' of the amendments required by the approval decisions were in force and being applied from 1 June 2023. The two amendments that had not yet entered into force at the moment of the adoption of the contested decision are, in the Commission's view, merely additional clarifications of measures already in force. The Hungarian Government, intervening in support of the Commission, asserts that the two amendments to which the Parliament refers were made to ensure the adoption of the additional detailed rules which were drafted and proposed on the basis of an exhaustive assessment by the Commission.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">81. Furthermore, the Commission considers that it could not request additional clarifications, as provided for under Article 15(4) of the CPR, since that would only be possible in the case of a negative assessment.

The second, third and fourth subparagraphs of Article 15(4) of the CPR regulate only the procedure in the case of a negative assessment by the Commission.

In my view, it is as much in the interest of the Member State in question, as it is in the interest of an effective and quick performance of the procedure, that the Commission should have the possibility to ask for further clarifications before it comes to either a positive or a negative decision. If the Commission does not have sufficient information, it cannot come to a positive decision and, therefore, in the interest of the proper implementation of the EU budget, could only adopt a negative one. In such a scenario, the entire procedure would have to start again, affording the Commission another three months to come to a decision after the Member State at issue has informed it of its implementation of the required reforms.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">85. In that sense, the requirement for clarification, therefore, does not necessarily prolong the period to the detriment of a Member State, but rather it enables the Commission to come to a positive decision more quickly. For that reason, and contrary to what the Commission contended, the suspension of the procedure while waiting for the clarification, or entry into force of new legislation, is not an infringement of the right of a Member State to receive a reasoned assessment as soon as possible.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">86. That means that, under the CPR, the Commission was not prevented from asking for additional clarifications, nor was it prevented from waiting for the entry into force of the reforms in question before it adopted a positive decision.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">87. In that light, it should be recalled that Decree 18/2023 and Section 35 of the act amending university laws (Act LXXXV of 2023) both became applicable in February 2024. The fact that the Commission had insisted on the addition of those amendments to the legislation reflects that the Commission viewed such amendments as not merely being 'additional' but rather quite necessary – hence, forming part of the aspects 'to be applied' before the adoption of any positive assessment.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">88. Since they were not yet applied, which was part of the conditions set in the approval decisions, the Commission infringed its obligations by adopting the contested decision prematurely, without providing any justification for such a decision.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">89.

In particular, point (b) of the fifth subparagraph of Article 3(3) of the approval decisions requires that the NJC be granted full legal capacity and budgetary autonomy. Point (d) of the fifth subparagraph of Article 3(3) thereof requires Hungary to make changes to the rules governing the election of judges to the NJC, and point (a) of the third subparagraph of Article 3(3) requires that the NJC be empowered to give binding opinions on regulations relating to the points system for the assessment of applications for judicial positions.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">91.

The Commission, supported by Hungary, argues that the act on judicial reforms (Act X of 2023), which entered into force before the contested decision was adopted, introduced the necessary reforms, which focused on granting the NJC extended powers over the NOJ. The nine-month incubation period only concerned management and organisational issues, which did not prevent the NJC from exercising its new powers over the NOJ. The requirements relating to the election of NJC members were only marginal, and in any case, the Commission had no reason to consider that the capacity and independence of the NJC prevented it from exercising the required functions of control over the NOJ.

With respect to the election of the President of the Kúria (Supreme Court), the Parliament asserts that the Commission did not adequately assess, prior to adopting the contested decision, the potential for the current President of the Kúria (Supreme Court) to be kept in office indefinitely by a decision of a one-third minority of the Országgyűlés (National Assembly).

With respect to the case allocation system, the Parliament raises four complaints. First, the allocation of cases to chambers without human intervention was not fully automated under Section 18 of the act on judicial reforms (Act X of 2023), <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote61\">(61)</a> a procedure which had not been implemented prior to the adoption of the contested decision. Moreover, in October 2023, the Commission required Hungary to provide written confirmation from an independent forensic expert or another equivalent profession that the electronically filed cases are given a case number without human intervention. That expert report had not been provided at the time of the contested decision. Second, the Parliament claims that the system lacks transparency because the reports published each week by the Kúria (Supreme Court) on its website contain incomplete data and that court does not envisage publishing the reasons for reassigning cases to another chamber. Where an exception has been applied, the only statement of reasons published was an indication of the legal provision applied in the case. The Parliament further claims that when cases are reassigned due to workload, there is no way to verify whether the original chamber did indeed have too heavy a workload. Moreover, the case allocation system should, in cases of derogation, record the decision in the case file and make it available to the parties. However, the Parliament notes that it is unclear whether such records are created at all, or, if they are created, whether they contain sufficient detail so as to enable the parties to assess whether the derogation is in compliance with the general rules. Third, from 1 January 2024, the case allocation rules allowed for new chambers to be set up which are competent to hear election-related cases in the context of the 2024 Parliament and municipal elections. (<a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote62\">62)</a> The Parliament alleges that there is no information available on the composition of those chambers. Fourth, the Parliament alleges that, in the approval decisions, the Commission ignored the fact that there may be issues with the case management system in lower-tier courts, as was presented in the 2023 rule of law report.

The Commission, supported by Hungary, maintains that the approval decisions do not contain a requirement of earlier removal of the President of the Kúria (Supreme Court), and in any event, his mandate is due to expire in 2028. Concerning the case allocation system, the Commission submits that Hungary implemented all the requirements set out in the approval decisions, and the absence of any human intervention was not a requirement for the allocation of cases. Instead, those decisions only required that the electronically filed cases be numbered without human intervention. Furthermore, the weekly log files published on that court's website verify that the electronically filed cases are given a sequential case number in the order in which they arrive and that they are allocated to the chambers in the same order. Moreover, when a specific derogation is made, the parties are provided with information on the applicable grounds for derogation. In relation to the workload derogation, the Commission states that the approval decisions required that objective data be available, a requirement which has been provided for since the NJC has been given the power to issue binding opinions on the data</p>",

Moreover, the Parliament alleges that the new rules on the case allocation scheme became applicable from 1 January 2024, which replaced the rules from December 2023, and they include the setting up of new chambers to hear electionrelated cases in the context of the Parliament and municipal elections. The Commission claims that it was unaware of the changes, yet its letters exchanged with Hungary reveal that the Commission had been informed of them. It was also aware that the new case allocation system would only take effect with the next amendment to the Kúria (Supreme Court) case allocation system, which was intended to come into force after the contested decision was adopted. Thus, there are objective indications that the Commission was aware that the allocation scheme would differ from the one it had requested, but it nonetheless rushed to give a positive assessment without confirming that the proper scheme was being applied or, at the very least, stating why such derogation was acceptable.</p>",

The Parliament claims that the reforms introduced by Sections 63 (<a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote68\">68)</a> and 64 (<a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote69\">69)</a> of the act on judicial reforms (Act X of 2023) do not expressly invalidate the precedential Decision Bt.III.838/2019/11 of the Kúria (Supreme Court), which the Court of Justice found to be in breach of EU law, (<a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote70\">70</a>) and which could have a chilling effect on judges who consider making references to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. In support of that argument, the Parliament invokes Section 3 of the act amending university laws (Act LXXXV of 2023), which introduced the possibility for the Alkotmánybíróság (Constitutional Court) to provide an opinion to the Court of Justice, within the framework of a preliminary ruling procedure, on matters such as national identity, security and sovereignty. In the Parliament's view, if read together with the law on the protection of national sovereignty (Law LXXXVIII of 2023), which was adopted during the same session of the Országgyűlés (National Assembly), that amendment could be understood as a signal to ordinary judges that questions on those matters are for the Alkotmánybíróság (Constitutional Court) to decide, which may thereby have a chilling effect on judges who consider making references for a preliminary ruling on related issues. In addition, the Parliament claims that the parts of the reform that were intended to remove the obstacles to submitting references for a preliminary ruling – in particular, the part concerning the removal of the statement 'applicable in the criminal proceedings' from Paragraph 490(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code – were not yet applicable on the day that the contested decision was adopted, as they were only introduced by Section 35 of the act amending university laws (Act LXXXV of 2023), which entered into force in 2024.</p>",

The Commission, supported by Hungary, is of the view that the legislative amendments, which entered into force on 1 June 2023 when Sections 63 and 64 of the act on judicial reforms (Act X of 2023) were adopted, had already removed any doubt concerning references for a preliminary ruling to which the applicant refers. The Commission also considers that, on the basis of both those legislative reforms and the judgment of the Court of Justice in <i>IS</i> <i>(Illegality</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>order</i> <i>for</i> <i>reference)</i>, it cannot be argued that Decision Bt.III.838/2019/11 of the Kúria (Supreme Court) would still have a chilling effect on judges. To that end, in order to ensure that no reasonable doubt remained, Hungary adopted Section 35 of the act amending university laws (Act LXXXV of 2023), by which it removed the words 'applicable in the criminal procedure' from Paragraph 490(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Although that specific amendment entered into force after the contested decision, the Commission believes that the main obstacles to preliminary references introduced by the precedential decision of the Kúria (Supreme Court) had already been removed by Sections 63 and 64 of the act on judicial reforms (Act X of 2023), which the Parliament did not challenge. As far as the belated removal by Section 35 of the act amending university laws (Act LXXXV of 2023) of the possibly misleading wording in the Criminal Procedure Code is concerned, the Commission explains that it was already clear from the explanatory memorandum to that code that any question can be referred to the Court of Justice. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote71\">(71)</a> Lastly, the Commission maintains that the Parliament failed to demonstrate how national judges are prevented from making a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling by the legislative amendment enabling the Alkotmánybíróság (Constitutional Court) to provide an interpretative opinion to the Court of Justice.</p>",

It is my understanding that Section 63 of the act on judicial reforms (Act X of 2023) did not fully remove the obstacles concerning references for a preliminary ruling, which is why Hungary subsequently adopted Section 35 of the act amending university laws (Act LXXXV of 2023), by which it deleted the words 'applicable in the criminal proceedings'. Therefore, the Parliament is correct in stating that the necessary legislative reform had not been in place at the time the contested decision was adopted. The Commission's explanation that its main concerns regarding preliminary rulings had already been addressed through other reforms undertaken by Hungary, and that the enactment of Section 35 – which had not entered into force at the time that the Commission adopted the contested decision – was simply an additional correction of the potentially misleading wording from the Criminal Procedure Code could, in principle, be accepted. However, in the contested decision, the Commission did not provide any reasoning as to why it did not wait for the act amending university laws (Act LXXXV of 2023) to enter into force before adopting the contested decision.</p>",

The Parliament claims that the Commission limited its assessment only to the list of conditions established in the approval decisions without considering other significant developments that occurred between the adoption of the approval decisions and the contested decision. In particular, the Parliament asserts that there is no evidence that the Commission considered Hungary's law on the protection of national sovereignty (Law LXXXVIII of 2023), <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote72\">(72)</a> which in its view encroaches on the constitutional competences of State institutions, including the courts, by creating an Office for the protection of national sovereignty ('the Office') (<a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footnote73\">73)</a> with broad powers to investigate any activity it deems contrary to national sovereignty. Section 8(2) of that law classifies the Office's investigations as non‑administrative, with the result that they cannot be challenged before an administrative court. In addition, its conclusions or reports are not subject to any judicial review. Consequently, the Parliament argues that the Commission should have secured assurances before issuing its positive assessment. Furthermore, the Parliament alleges that the Commission's assessment did not take into account concerns raised within the framework of the European Semester and the 2023 Rule of Law Mechanism, which post-dated the approval decisions.

The Parliament alleges that, although it could not examine the correspondence between the Commission and Hungary from 11 to 13 December 2023, the available indicia show that the Commission misused its powers when it gave a positive assessment of the Charter HEC. The Parliament contends that such a favourable assessment was given in exchange for the Hungarian Prime Minister's decision to leave the room, thereby allowing the remaining members of the European Council to decide on opening accession negotiations with Ukraine on 14 and 15 December 2023. Supporting evidence includes the Prime Minister's repeated linking of Ukrainian funding to the blocking of EU funds for Hungary, social media posts showing him exiting during the vote, statements from a Commission member, the decision being drafted solely in English and the payment to Hungary on 27 December 2023 – a day on which the Commission does not work. Finally, the Parliament argues that the Commission had no obligation to deliver its assessment by that date and that the contested decision fails to explain why it did not wait for the required reforms to become applicable.</p>",

The Commission, supported by Hungary, argues that the Parliament has not shown that the contested decision deviates from the objectives that justify the Commission's powers. It further maintains that it had to respect a three-month deadline that began on 18 July 2023, which was suspended twice and only resumed after Hungary submitted clarifications; consequently, the deadline elapsed before the end of the year. The fact that the decision was adopted 10 working days before that deadline does not, in the Commission's view, indicate a rushed procedure, because the file had been examined for nearly 5 months, which is well beyond the 3-month time limit and goes beyond the remit of Article 15(4) of the CPR, which requires a position to be taken 'as soon as possible and no later than 3 months' after receipt of the Member State self‑assessment. Accordingly, the Commission maintains that it complied with Article 15(4) of the CPR. Finally, the internal decision empowering a director‑general to send the letter was taken in a written procedure, drafted solely in English in accordance with the authorisation of the President of the Commission under the Commission's Rules of Procedure, and the annexed letter was subsequently translated into Hungarian.</p>",

The fact that the funds were released when all concrete requirements were not yet fulfilled – thus prematurely – and that this has happened without any explanation may lead a reasonable person to question the real motivation behind the contested decision. However, assumptions or 'indicia', as the Parliament calls them, that the EU funds were, in fact, released to Hungary in exchange for political favours, are mainly based on social media posts, interviews and newspaper reports. Those are, in my view, insufficient to prove that the Commission adopted the contested decision with the exclusive or primary purpose of achieving an objective other than establishing that Hungary had implemented the required legislative reforms concerning judicial independence – the very condition that would qualify it to receive the disbursement of the CPR funds.</p>",

However, the claim relating to the 'flawed assessment' in the second, third, fourth and fifth part of the Parliament's first plea must, in relation to some of the claims, be read not as relating to the erroneous establishment of facts, but rather as incorrect application of law. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref53\">53</a> I cannot but observe that the present case has revealed that many steps relating to the use of the EU funds and the implementation of different forms of conditionality in that respect are not sufficiently transparent. That is at odds with the principle of democracy as it makes it difficult for EU citizens to understand how and why many of the budgetary decisions are taken. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref54\">54</a> See, for instance, Article 3 of Implementing Decision C(2022) 10004 approving the Environmental and Energy Efficiency Operational Programme Plus. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref55\">55</a> See recital 9 of the approval decisions. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref56\">56</a> Amending Subtitle 63 of the act on the organisation of courts (Act CLXI of 2011). <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref57\">57</a> See recitals 10 and 11 of the approval decisions. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref58\">58</a> In particular, the candidates for that position must have at least five years of experience as a judge, he or she cannot be re-elected, and the NJC is to give a binding opinion on the suitability of the candidate for that position. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref59\">59</a> In particular, the case numbers have to be attributed without human intervention, cases should be allocated to chambers following preestablished and objective criteria, the bench hearing the case must be composed following an algorithm prescribed in advance, the parties to the proceedings should be able to verify on the basis of the case file whether the rules on case allocation have been duly applied, and the judicial council of the Kúria (Supreme Court) and the Kollegium (departments of judges) should be able to give a binding opinion on the case allocation scheme. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref60\">60</a> As pointed out in the Commission's 2023 Rule of law report – Country chapter on the rule of law situation in Hungary, 2023, p. 7 ('the 2023 rule of law report'): 'A blocking minority in Parliament can prevent the election of a new president, thereby keeping the incumbent in office for an undetermined period of time.' <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref61\">61</a> Amending Section 10(4)(c) of the act on the organisation of courts (Act CLXI of 2011). <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref62\">62</a> Provision VI.4 of the case allocation scheme provides that the head of the administrative department may, by special order, assign election-related cases to three-member chambers VIII, IX, X, and XI, if more than 15 electoral cases are brought before the Kúria within a period of three calendar days. The four chambers VIII, IX, X and XI, are new chambers, specially introduced only for electoral disputes, and apart from that, they do not function, which is why those specific chambers are referred to as 'phantom' chambers. Without those amendments, the electoral disputes would be decided by the existing three member chambers. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref63\">63</a> See the 2023 rule of law report, p. 6. <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref64\">64</a> Amending Section 114(1) of the act on the organisation of courts (Act CLXI of 2011). <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref65\">65</a> See, judgments of 5 November 2019, <i>Commission</i> v <i>Poland</i> <i>(Independence</i> <i>of</i> <i>ordinary</i> <i>courts)</i> (C‑192/18, EU:C:2019:924, paragraph 115), and of 7 May 2024, <i>NADA</i> <i>and</i> <i>Others</i> (C‑115/22, EU:C:2024:384, paragraphs 43 and 44). <a href=\"file:///tmp/wktemp-23981bee-beab-4963-a740-5fac22f8a0d8.html#Footref66\">66</a> Amending Section 10(4) of the act on the organisation of courts (Act CLXI of 2011).
