Parallel importers are at greater risk of delivery failure because they usually don't have a stable source of delivery e.g. in the form of an exclusive agreement with the relevant producer or own production. Summarized this causes bids from parallel importers being less competitive. The case is thus of fundamental importance for the regions' (Amgros') procurement of medicine.</p>",
