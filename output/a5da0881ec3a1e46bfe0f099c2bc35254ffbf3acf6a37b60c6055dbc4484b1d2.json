      "html": "<p block-type=\"ListGroup\"><ul><li block-type=\"ListItem\">(1) Article 11a(3) of Directive 2008/98/EC requires Member States to establish an effective system of quality control and traceability of municipal waste to ensure that the conditions for the calculation and measurement of the municipal waste recycled are met. The weight of the municipal waste recycled is, as a general rule, to be measured when the waste enters the recycling operation. However, the weight of municipal waste recycled may instead be measured at the output of any sorting operation, provided that the output waste is subseqeuntly recycled and that the weight of materials and substances which are removed after a sorting operation by other preliminary treatment and which are not subsequently recycled is not included in the weight of waste reported as recycled. Member States may use average loss rates ('ALRs') for sorted waste within the system of quality control and traceability of municipal waste as a method to determine the amount of those materials and substances.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">(2) This situation can occur where sorted waste undergoes a series of further sorting or other preliminary treatment operations in several waste treatment facilities whereby fractions of the sorted waste are separated or mixed with other types of waste, with waste from other sources, or with waste from other countries before reaching the calculation point. When Member States use ALRs, they should verify national-based average loss rates from a sample of sorting facilities in situations when reliable data cannot be obtained from the waste operators in whose facilities the waste reached the calculation point.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">(3) ALRs for sorted waste should account for targeted and non-targeted materials and substances that are removed from sorted waste and are not effectively recycled at the calculation point. Losses should include all losses of targeted and non-targeted materials by the recycling facility between the measurement point and up to the calculation point, including losses relating to preliminary operations which take place in the recycling facility upstream of the calculation point.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">(4) Losses represent materials in sorted waste that cannot be effectively recycled in recycling processes and are neither sent to recycling operations nor prepared for reuse. ALRs are to be used only where reliable data on the amount of waste recycled cannot be obtained otherwise.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">(5) For the purposes of calcuating the ALRs, data on losses per waste stream should be obtained from a representative sample of sorting facilities producing sorted waste between the calculation point and the measurement point. Data should be retrieved through sampled sorting facilities, either estimated from a compositional analysis or calculated by using mass balances. Mass balances should be used to deduce the amounts of recycled materials from the difference between the total amount of material entering the sorting facility and the amounts of non-targeted material removed before the calculation point.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">(6) In order to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the data and other information necessary for the proper calculation of ALRs, it is necessary to lay down requirements on the collection of data and their regular update for the purpose of verification. In order to reflect changes in waste composition and waste management practices, it is appropriate to set out the criteria for adjusting the established ALRs. In particular, it is essential to establish such uniform calculation and verification rules for plastic packaging, as the amount of non recycled plastic packaging has financial implications for the Union in that it is concidered an own resource in the Union budget.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">(7) In order to promote high quality sorting and recycling and to enable the waste management operators and Member States that ship sorted waste for recycling to determine the applicable ALRs for their waste, it is necessary to lay down rules on the accessibility of such rates. It should be possible to calculate ALRs by surveying and compiling data from a representative sample of sorting plants,</li></ul></p>",
