Furthermore, the preliminary investigation showed that the relevant market was likely to be the Danish market for projecting, installing, servicing etc. of automatic sprinkler systems. Based on information from the involved parties, it is estimated that at least 90 per cent of the work on sprinkler systems in Denmark is conducted by companies certified under RL001.</p>",
