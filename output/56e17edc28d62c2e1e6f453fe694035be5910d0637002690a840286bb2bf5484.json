Building on this strategic direction, the EU Defence Industry Transformation Roadmap, adopted on 19 November 2025, calls for a fundamental shift in mindset and processes across the European defence ecosystem towards greater speed, agility and risk-taking. It explicitly identifies the need to develop new, more responsive approaches to support disruptive defence innovation and the emergence of new defence players.</p>",
