According to the agreements, the outlets receive marketing support from Carlsberg on the condition that the outlets are not selling beer from competing suppliers (outlet-exclusivity). The main part of these agreements provide for exclusivity only on draught beer. However, a limited number of the agreements provide for exclusivity also on bottled beer and CSDs. The lastmentioned agreements (sponsorship agreements) cover [1-3] % (out of the [6-10] %) (2003) of the total sale of beer to the horecasector and are typically concluded on the basis of a bidding contest.

In outlets with a draught beer installation the sale of draught beer constitutes up to 80 % of the total beer sale. Moreover, the DCA found that it is unlikely that an outlet operator who has an installation agreement with Carlsberg will replace or supplement Carlsberg's beer installation - supplied free of charge - with a beer installation owned by the outlet operator himself or a third party. Therefore, according to the DCA's preliminary assessment, the installation agree-ments will often amount to de facto outlet-exclusivity. In other words, the equipment-exclusivity unduly hinders the outlets from turning to Carlsberg's competitors and, thus, reduces the competitive pressure on Carlsberg.</p>",
